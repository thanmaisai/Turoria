Mentors are student centric teachers-friends-guides who help young learners in 
their transitory phases and challenging academic times. Mentoring program has 
been introduced for obtaining a realistic assessment of the learner’s performance 
and for providing inclusive spaces for academic growth and skillful development 
of the student’s community. Mentors offer their guidance,knowledge, 
experience and expertise in promoting their mentees overall development. 
Mentoring is a loyal, sincere, confidential partnership between mentor and the 
student mentee. Mentorship serve as reliable guides- like a parent as wellas a teacher, throughout their institutional learning.

One-to-one tutoring is extremely beneficial to all parties, moreover, there’s a great difference in the learning outcomes and cognitive achievements of apprentices and those working on their own or in a group, according to the researchers from MIT, with those who received mentorship excelling at all points.

Being a mentor could boost your own career, according to Sun Microsystems, who outlined in their research that ‘’both mentors and mentees were more than 20% more likely to have gotten a raise than people who didn’t participate in the mentoring program at all.’’

Taking a step further from statistics, let’s summarize the reasons why you would need to have a mentor in the first place:

When you’re stuck at any particular coding problem, mentors can help you solve it;
- If you’re stuck between two career paths or choices, mentors can help you decide what best suits your personality, knowledge, or interests;
- If you are very slow at achieving your goals, mentors can help accelerate your learning.
- If you need inspiration, mentors can be a great source of new ideas, challenges, and motivation;
- If you need to prepare for coding interviews, mentors can guide you through a set of appropriate challenges and advise on
strategies for tackling the most difficult questions.
